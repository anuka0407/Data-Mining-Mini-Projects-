# **Predicting Birthright for Babies**

## **Abstract**

summary of our questions, methods, results, and conclusions in a few 100
words

## **Introduction**

Baby announcements are sweet and memorable. Expecting parents usually
know their approximate due date at the beginning of the pregnancy and
learn about their baby’s gender at around 20 weeks mark. While gender
reveal, time of birth and name of the new baby are all exciting and
great news for the entire family to have, OB-GYNS mostly look at baby’s
development, growth and their weight. Estimating baby weight in
particular is very important, since a large size baby can pose serious
injuries to the baby and its mother. Ultrasounds are often used to
estimate baby’s weight, but they are not always accurate. When I was
over 40 weeks pregnant, my doctor told me that the baby was an average
size and I didnot need to be induced, however my daughter was born over
8.9lbs which was significantly larger than the estimated size and it
made my delivery more complicated. So While exploring my project ideas,
I came across to the NBER natality birth data from 2018 that contained
the features of the baby like birth date, gender, medical conditions of
the birth mother, number of children born etc. My goal is to predict the
birthright of the baby depending on the week of pregnancy. Better
estimations used by doctors should mean easier deliveries and less
complications and its interesting to see how machine learning tools
could help us estimate the birthweight.

## **Methods**

My dataset birthweight18.csv contains 50000 randomly chosen samples from
2018 U.S. data files
(<https://www.nber.org/research/data/vital-statistics-natality-birth-data>).
There are 42 variables that were chosen from the initial 142 variables
on the dataset.

## **Data Exploration**
